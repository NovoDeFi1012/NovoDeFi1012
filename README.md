## What is Novo?
Novo is the first decentralized and deflationary duel-reward (Reflection & Staking Rewards) cryptocurrency protocol available on the **Binance Smart Chain** based on the **NOVO** token. The primary purpose of the Novo Protocol is to maintain stability and positive market-capitalization growth, not through the arbitrary and unbacked creation of new tokens or unnatural elastic supply adjustments, but by utilizing transactionary volume and implementing a myriad of mechanisms like **Automatic Regenerative Liquidity (ARL)**, growth of **Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL)**, and unique **Price Recovery Mechanism (PRM)**, all while maintaining static rewards and introducing compounded rewards through staking. At the heart of all of this is the [**NOVO Smart Treasury.**](https://novo-2.gitbook.io/welcome-to-gitbook/novo-smart-treasury)

## What is Novo? (Simplified)
Unlike similar protocols, Novo does not rely on the adjustment of the overall supply or minting new tokens to fuel new growth. Novo is, and always will be, deflationary, meaning the supply will constantly be decreasing, causing the price per token to rise. 5% of each swap transaction (Buying and Selling) and 2% of each transfer contributes to 5 different functions:

> 1. Reflections - Holders earn passive rewards through static reflection as they watch their balance of Novo grow indefinitely.
> 2. Staking Rewards - Unlike other reflection tokens, you can also stake your tokens to earn a greater share of the rewards, all without having to sacrifice your reflections.
> 3. Regenerative Liquidity - Every trade contributes towards auto-generating liquidity that is made available for trading on decentralized exchanges.
> 4. Burn - A portion of the transaction is burned forever, decreasing overall supply.
> 5. Treasury - A small fee is sent to the treasury to implement PRM (Price Recover Mechanism)

A healthy project not only has massive amounts of liquidity, but also has POL (Protocol owned liquidity). By owning its own liquidity, Novo does not have to pay out high farming rewards to "rent" liquidity. It also means that on top of creating a stable environment to facilitate transactions, the protocol can earn a larger share of the LP fees which fuels more PRM from the treasury.

Similar protocols rely on staking and selling bonds to generate liquidity, but Novo has regenerative liquidity happening with each trade, on top of offering staking.

And lastly, the Novo Treasury has the ability to perform market functions that help with price recovery in bear runs, by using funds to purchase Novo from the market, automatically executing the 5 transitionary functions.

## What is the point of Novo?
Many decentralized finance protocols have unique mechanisms that make them great experiments as a store-of-value, but all lack staying power. Most projects rely on influx of new capital and investors and often show their true colors in a bear market when selling outweighs new investors and the reduction in price exceeds that of their bonds/staking rewards. Novo was created to combat this by being a volume based protocol. By holding and staking Novo, you are earning a large quantity of new tokens every second, regardless of whether or not the price direction or the amount of people buying bonds or minting new tokens.

## How do I participate in Novo?
There are two main strategies for market participants: Holding and Staking. Stakers stake their **NOVO** tokens in return for more **NOVO** tokens, while holders simply hold Novo in their DeFi wallet to receive more **NOVO**.

## Our Mission
To facilitate the mass adoption of Decentralized Finance by offering a cryptocurrency that inherently maintains long term protocol health, stability, and liquidity, through automated smart contracts to counteract illogical human behavior and short-sided decision making. In addition to a unique store-of-value currency, Novo's mission is to create tools and services focused on usability, ease of adoption, and security.

## Long Term Vision
Diversifying and investing in DeFi is incredibly complicated and technical. The Novo vision is to be the bridge between traditional retail investors and blockchain products and services.

## Who Created Novo
Novo was proudly created by Andrew Eddy in Atlanta, Ga. Our team is mostly anonymous developers across the glove with an enthusiasm for DeFi. 

## Who Runs Novo?
Most decisions are currently made by the Core Team from community sourced feedback.
